CEE0099 is the Lab of Digital Control at Universidade Federal do Piau√≠.
It all started from [pic-usart](https://github.com/fmarcolino/pic-usart).

This is the "ufpi" branch, with MATLAB interfacing code.

This repository was meant to be used at the CEE0099 "Controle Digital" class at UFPI.
All the experiments could be done by modifying "impulso.m" or "degrau.slx".
I recomend saving modified versions of those files with different names.

EXAMPLE: Make "open_step.slx" that's a open loop step on "ventilador", 
starting from "degrau.slx", which is a closed loop step.

Please let me know if any other class would like to use it as well.
